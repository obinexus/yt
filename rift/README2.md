- Sustainable development velocity through care-driven methodology
- Context preservation through import(disk) metaphor
- Governance through care rather than fear

### **Thread Keeper**
**Definition:** A RIFTer who specializes in thread-safe programming and concurrent system design, ensuring no threads are "ghosted" or left in race conditions.  
**Technical Responsibilities:** Monitoring thread lifecycles, preventing deadlocks, ensuring atomic operations, maintaining timing attack resistance.  
**Community Role:** Mentors other developers in thread safety practices, reviews concurrent code for safety violations.

## Mobile Development Terminology

### **app.rift**
**Definition:** Universal mobile application framework file defining cross-platform development configurations for iOS, Android, Web, Desktop, and Embedded systems.  
**Technical Scope:** Contains platform detection patterns, safety-critical components, thread safety guarantees, and polyglot integration directives.  
**Implementation:** Central configuration file for RIFT mobile development, enabling single-codebase deployment across all platforms.

### **Platform Detection Patterns**
**Definition:** R-syntax regular expressions used to identify runtime platforms and configure appropriate implementations.  
**Examples:**
- `R"(^(iPhone|iPad|iPod).*iOS\s+(\d+)\.(\d+))"` for iOS detection
- `R"(Android\s+(\d+)\.(\d+)(?:\.(\d+))?)"` for Android detection
**Technical Implementation:** Compile-time pattern matching enabling automatic platform-specific optimization.

### **Polyglot Bridge**
**Definition:** GOSSIP protocol implementation enabling seamless communication between different programming languages within a single application.  
**Supported Bridges:** Swift (iOS), JNI (Android), WASM (Web), Native (Desktop), Bare Metal (Embedded).  
**Technical Guarantee:** Thread-safe FFI with zero race conditions across language boundaries.

## Safety-Critical Terminology

### **Medical Device Mode**
**Definition:** Special RIFT compilation mode enforcing NASA Power of Ten compliance, constant-time operations, and hardware-isolated state management for life-critical applications.  
**Requirements:** 
- True Positive/True Negative ≥ 95%
- False Positive/False Negative ≤ 5%
- Latency guarantees < 50ms
- Thread safety verification: EXHAUSTIVE
**Example Applications:** Sleep apnea monitors, ventilators, patient telemetry systems.

### **QA Metrics Bound Region**
**Definition:** Defined operational parameters within which quality assurance metrics must maintain specified thresholds for stakeholder compliance.  
**Technical Framework:** Statistical boundaries enforcing minimum accuracy requirements across all safety-critical operations.  
**Stakeholder Interface:** Real-time dashboard presenting TP/TN/FP/FN rates to medical professionals and regulatory bodies.

### **Vitals Pattern Matching**
**Definition:** Specialized R-syntax patterns for parsing and validating medical device telemetry data.  
**Example:** `R'(^VITALS:\s*HR=(\d+)\s*SPO2=(\d+)\s*RR=(\d+)$)'`  
**Safety Requirement:** Must achieve 100% parsing accuracy with fail-safe defaults for malformed data.

## Development Methodology Extensions

### **#hacc Philosophy**
**Definition:** "Human-Aligned Caring Computing" - development approach prioritizing human wellbeing and understanding in technical systems.  
**Core Tenets:** 
- Code that breathes with patients through the night
- No ghosting of threads or developers
- Sorry not sorry for high standards
- Services from the heart
**Implementation:** Reflected in error messages, documentation style, and developer experience design.

### **#noghosting Principle**
**Definition:** Commitment to never abandoning threads, processes, developers, or users without proper closure and care.  
**Technical Implementation:** Guaranteed thread lifecycle management, comprehensive error handling, graceful shutdown procedures.  
**Community Implementation:** Responsive maintainership, thorough documentation, supportive developer relations.

### **#sorrynotsorry Standards**
**Definition:** Unapologetic commitment to excellence in thread safety, code quality, and system reliability.  
**Application:** Strict enforcement of safety standards without compromise, even when it increases development complexity.  
**Philosophy:** Better to be demanding about safety than apologetic about failures.

## GOSSIP Protocol Extensions

### **GOSSIP Pin Directives**
**Definition:** Protocol-specific connection definitions enabling polyglot communication channels.  
**Syntax Examples:**
- `GOSSIP pinAPI TO NODE { ... }` - Node.js service integration
- `GOSSIP pinML TO PYTHON { ... }` - Python ML model execution
- `GOSSIP pinLegacy TO PHP { ... }` - PHP legacy system bridge
**Technical Guarantee:** All GOSSIP channels maintain thread safety across language boundaries.

### **Gossip Networking**
**Definition:** Distributed communication pattern where components share state and messages through cryptographically secure, thread-safe channels.  
**Implementation:** ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption, Ed25519 signatures, atomic message passing.  
**Mascot Representation:** Gini the parrot "gossips" between different language environments, translating messages seamlessly.

## Compilation and Build Terminology

### **R-Syntax Optimization**
**Definition:** Compiler optimization specifically for processing R"" and R'' raw string literals in C, eliminating escape sequence overhead.  
**Performance Impact:** Reduces regex compilation time, improves pattern matching efficiency, enables cleaner code.  
**CLI Flag:** `--r-syntax` enables optimization during compilation.

### **Stage-Bound Mobile Compilation**
**Definition:** Mobile-specific compilation pipeline ensuring platform optimizations occur within defined stage boundaries.  
**Stages:**
1. Platform detection and R-syntax preprocessing
2. Thread safety validation and policy enforcement  
3. Platform-specific optimization and binary generation
**Quality Gate:** Each stage must achieve mobile-specific performance targets (startup < 100ms, memory < 50MB).

### **Universal App Binary**
**Definition:** Single compiled artifact capable of executing across multiple platforms through runtime detection and dynamic module loading.  
**Technical Innovation:** Platform-specific code paths selected at runtime without performance penalty.  
**Size Optimization:** NLINK tree-shaking removes unused platform implementations from final binary.

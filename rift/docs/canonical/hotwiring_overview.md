# OBINexus Computing: Hot-Wiring Architecture Overview

## Executive Summary

Hot-wiring architecture represents OBINexus Computing's systematic approach to creative system integration, transforming legacy and disparate technologies into cohesive, high-value computing solutions.

## Core Methodology

### Principle Definition
**Hot-Wiring**: Finding non-obvious, high-leverage connection points between technologies, platforms, and cultural systems to unlock unexpected value and accelerate function.

### Technical Implementation
- **Bypass traditional overhead** through lean system integration
- **Repurpose legacy systems** via OBINexus framework integration  
- **Generate emergent utility** through cross-protocol innovation

## Technology Stack Integration

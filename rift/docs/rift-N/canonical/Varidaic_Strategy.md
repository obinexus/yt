Abstract
This paper presents a formalized framework for Dimensional Game Theory with
a focus on variadic input systems and strategic balance in multi-domain competitive
environments. We introduce methods for recognizing context-sensitive inputs, scalar-
to-vector transitions, and adaptive dimension detection. These tools enable practical
computation of strategic minima in games with infinite or evolving input spaces.
```
## 1 Introduction

Traditional game theory fails to scale in systems where inputs are dynamic, sparse, or contex-
tually unlocked. In real-world strategy systems-such as AI coordination, adaptive defense,
or market reaction-the structure of the game itself shifts based on dimensional input ac-
tivations. This work builds upon classical formulations by introducing a formal method to
manage these changes through a dimension-configured framework.

## 2 From Scalars to Dimensions

In many scenarios, an input appears initially as a scalar but holds the potential to become
a full dimension. For example, voice communication in a tactical simulation may begin as
a toggle variable (present/absent), but once active, contributes a wide range of influence
across multiple axes (emotion, intent, deception).
Definition 1 (Scalar Promotion):An inputxis said to be promoted to dimensionD
if:
?f:x?vD?Rnsuch that??vD?> e (1)

for some thresholdedefining significance in game context.

## 3 Variadic Game Framework

LetG= (N,A,u,D) where:

#### 1


- N is the set of players
- Ais the action space (can be variadic)
- uis the utility function
- Dis the set of activated strategic dimensions

Inputs toAare not fixed in number, and dimensions inDare conditionally activated
based on input state and contextual triggers.
Definition 2 (Contextual Activation):A dimensionDiis considered active if:

```
Xm
```
```
j=
```
```
d(xj,Di)=t (2)
```
wheredmaps inputxjto a relevance score underDi, andtis a domain-defined activation
threshold.

## 4 Strategic Balance in High-Dimensional Systems

Adding parameters naively is computationally infeasible. Instead, we define strategy as a
function over theactive dimensional space.
Definition 3 (Strategic Vector):LetSibe a strategy for playeridefined over active
dimensionsDact. Then:

```
Si=?s= [sD 1 ,sD 2 ,...,sDk] whereDj?Dact (3)
```
Theorem (Computational Reduction):The game is solvable within tractable bounds
iff|Dact|=ù, for system-defined computability threshold ù.

## 5 Dimensional Activation Mapping

To prevent overload and misclassification, we define a mapping function:

```
f:{x 1 ,x 2 ,...,xn}Dact (4)
```
This function identifies and filters which scalar or vector inputs activate dimension-specific
strategies.

## 6 Conclusion

Dimensional Game Theory in its variadic form provides a robust structure for handling
complex, evolving, and multidimensional strategic interactions. Rather than treating all
variables equally, we prioritize strategic dimensionality, enabling AI and human systems to
focus on meaningful, actionable game inputs while preserving computational feasibility.

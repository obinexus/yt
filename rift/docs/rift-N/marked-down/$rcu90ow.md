# RIFTLang Implementation Specification Document
**Version 1.0 | May 2025**

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive specification for the RIFTLang implementation as part of the broader RIFT ecosystem developed by Nnamdi Michael Okpala. It establishes the technical requirements, component architecture, and development sequence for the core `.rift` language toolchain. The specification follows a two-track development methodology (Foundation and Aspirational) with clearly defined milestones, prioritization, and gate requirements.

## RIFT Ecosystem Overview

RIFTLang is a component within the broader RIFT ecosystem that includes:

1. **LibRIFT**: Foundational library providing flexible automaton-based pattern matching, thread safety, and memory management with policy enforcement
2. **RIFTLang**: Language toolchain for creating Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) on top of LibRIFT
3. **NLINK (NexusLink)**: Component linking technology with state machine minimization capabilities
4. **GosiLang**: Polyglot language for cross-language communication built using RIFTLang

This specification focuses specifically on the RIFTLang component development.

## Implementation Sequencing Recommendation

1. Implement core `Token` structure with bitfield constraints
2. Develop the thread safety foundation with `LockContext`
3. Create the parser pipeline with AST generation
4. Implement policy validation with the `ResultMatrix2x2` framework
5. Integrate with NLINK using post-parse state minimization

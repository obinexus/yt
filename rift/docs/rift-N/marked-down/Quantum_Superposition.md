# README: Quantum Superposition in `.rift`

In RIFT modules, superposition particles are resolved by sharing **state superposition** over qubits, ensuring that any information from:

1. `interface`
2. `entanglement`

...is respected before state collapse occurs.

When collapse is triggered, **entropy and informational state** are redistributed across the memory span.

### Suppose:

* You have **8 qubits**: `10101011`
* This is equivalent to a **1-byte classical representation**
* The total possible states in this span: `2^32 = 4,294,967,296 qitems`

This state space allows for flexible resolution models:

#### Model 1: Shared Entropy Distribution

Entropy is **smeared across the span**, enabling coherent resolution over the entire space. Good for broad-context execution.

#### Model 2: Segmented Entropy Storage

Entropy is **isolated into memory segments**, enabling fine-grained control and localized observation.

### Usage Philosophy:

> If you need the entropy, you get it. If you want the information, you get it. Just pick the right superposition you need.

This encapsulates RIFT's reflection-first architecture: computation is not rushed. It is selected, observed, and **governed**.

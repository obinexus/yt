# RIFT Integration Standard

This directory contains the specification for the RIFT Legacy Language Integration & Standardization Protocol. The document `RIFT_Integration_Standard_v4.0.0.md` describes how RIFT bridges legacy COBOL systems with modern Python and XML workflows under the LibPolyCall protocol. It serves as a reference for implementing cross-language integration, asynchronous processing, and comprehensive QA practices.

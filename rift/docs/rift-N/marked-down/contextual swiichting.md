# Understanding the RIFT Ecosystem: Token Architecture and Memory Governance

The RIFT ecosystem represents an innovative approach to language engineering, emphasizing governance, memory safety, and deterministic execution. At its core, LibRIFT provides the foundation for this ecosystem, while RIFTLang builds upon it with a sophisticated token architecture.

## Token Architecture: The Triplet Model

RIFTLang is built on a triplet token model that forms the foundation of its governance system:

```
token = (token_type, token_value, token_memory)
```

Where:
- **token_type**: Defines the entity classification (INT, ROLE, MASK, OP in classical mode; QBYTE, QROLE, QMATRIX in quantum mode)
- **token_value**: Contains the actual data or symbolic representation
- **token_memory**: Handles memory alignment, execution constraints, and governance policies

This triplet structure enables RIFTLang to implement its core philosophy: "only compile what has been governed." Each token must conform to explicit memory alignment rules and policy constraints before it can be processed.

### Memory-First Parsing Principles
RIFTLang flips traditional parsing on its head:
- You don’t start with type—you start with **memory**.
- Memory is aligned and declared before value or type is assigned.

Semantic principles:
- `a :=` **Top-down:** type first, memory structure declared before assignment
- `b :=` **Bottom-up:** value triggers structure inference
- `c :=` **Literal bulk:** `int<span 8, CREATE | READ | DELETE, T>` → mass declaration of T roles, statically or dynamically allocated

### Memory Structure Constructs
To support semantic span binding, RIFTLang defines five structural types:
- `vector`: ordered and indexed (expandable span)
- `tuple`: ordered, non-indexed (opaque structure contracts)
- `array`: ordered, fixed, and indexable (bounded)
- `map`: key-value storage with explicit anchors
- `dsa`: distributed structural arrays, supporting concurrent role projection

These shapes are fundamental to the RIFTLang parser, enabling expressive memory layouts that can govern token instantiation directly.

## Memory Alignment and Governance

Memory management in RIFTLang operates through structured "spans" that define how memory is allocated, accessed, and protected:

```
align span<row> {
  direction: right -> left,
  bytes: 8^4,       // Million-bit scale memory vector
  type: continuous, // Span lives in active aligned memory
  open: true        // Span is mutable, appendable
}
```

The system enforces strict alignment rules (4096b in classical mode) that govern how tokens interact with memory. This alignment-first approach ensures memory safety by prioritizing structure over data.

## Classical vs. Quantum Modes

RIFTLang operates in two distinct modes, each with different memory behaviors:

### Classical Mode
- Sequential, deterministic execution
- Explicit memory masks for CRUD operations
- Locked concurrency model
- Strict 4096-bit alignment
- No parallel masking allowed

Memory operations follow three key principles:
1. Type precedes value
2. Type and value are resolved bottom-up
3. Batch declaration of typed memory regions

### Quantum Mode
- Parallel, concurrent execution
- Memory alignment happens simultaneously
- Supports superposition, entanglement, and distributed values
- Dynamic 8-qubit alignment
- Phase-locked concurrency

This dual-mode approach allows RIFTLang to support both traditional deterministic computing and more advanced quantum-inspired paradigms.

## Continuous Switching (Quantum-Classical Context Awareness)

Continuous Switching is a key primitive that governs execution across both classical and quantum contexts. It enables a memory structure to operate:
- In sequence or in parallel depending on mode
- With or without context switching through semaphores
- By observing semantic memory roles, not just execution timing

### Behavior:
- In **classical** mode: switching is simulated through semaphore-locked memory threads (pseudo-concurrency)
- In **quantum** mode: switching happens natively via superposition and phase-interference logic

```
primitive ContextualSwitching {
  mode: HYBRID,
  memory: aligned,
  concurrency: context-aware,
  switching: true_contextual,
  structure: deterministic | superposed,
  dataflow: paused_or_parallel
}
```

This primitive allows any memory block, type, or span to adopt true concurrency semantics in quantum mode, while remaining structured and deterministic in classical mode.

> Anything quantum is also classical—Continuous Switching proves the architecture just needs structure first.

## The Governance Philosophy

The RIFT ecosystem implements governance through explicit policy enforcement at the token level. Rather than applying security or type safety as afterthoughts, these constraints are baked into the token structure itself.

The governance model follows zero-trust principles where every token must prove its compliance with memory alignment and access policies before it can be executed. This ensures that beliefs (in the form of code) must be "compiled" through policy validation before they can be executed.

This comprehensive approach to governance, from memory alignment to execution constraints, creates a system where safety and determinism are first-class citizens, not afterthoughts.

RIFTLang doesn’t just parse input—it **constructs intention**.

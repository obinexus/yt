**Problem: RIFT Governance File for Polyglot Module Set**

Design and define a RIFT (.riftrc) governance configuration file for a safety-critical software module composed of multiple source languages (e.g., C, H, RIFTlang). This configuration file should serve as a formal declaration of memory governance, type safety, semantic integrity enforcement, and trust-level expectations for all modules contained within a given project directory.

# .riftrc.toml â€” RIFT Governance File
```
[project]
name = "airflow_control"
description = "Safety-critical C module for respiratory sync"
version = "0.3.7"
governance_mode = "classical" # or "quantum" if you're feeling reckless

[memory]
alignment = "span<row>"
default_bytes = 4096
mutable = true

[types]
pointer_width = 64
default_signed = true
endianness = "explicit"

[languages]
allowed = ["c", "h", "riftlang"]
entrypoint = "src/main.c"

[modules]
root = "src/"
include = ["*.c", "*.h"]
exclude = ["test/", "legacy/", "notes.md"]

[policies]
trust_level = 3 # Verified Trust starts at 4, don't flatter yourself
cryptographic_attestation = true
enforce_zero_recursion = true
semantic_fingerprint_required = true

[governance.contracts]
memory_governance = true
token_validation = "strict"
runtime_policy_enforcement = true
audit_trail = true

[interop]
gosi_enabled = true
allowed_foreign_langs = ["python", "rust"]
libpolycalls = true
sandbox_legacy = true

[documentation]
import_disk = true
retain_context = true
token_history_enabled = true
```

**Objectives:**

* Govern a project directory containing C source files and headers, with optional RIFTlang modules.
* Define compilation and runtime policies according to the RIFTer ecosystem's "one pass, no recursion" principle.
* Ensure memory alignment, pointer abstraction, and endianness normalization across languages.
* Support cross-language semantic validation and policy-bound integration via GosiLang and LibPolyCall.
* Require explicit governance declarations for memory, typing, and access permissions.
* Enable import-disk documentation to retain semantic history across development sessions.

This problem should define the foundation for subsequent issues, such as runtime trust scoring, semantic DAG validation, multi-agent governance negotiation, or quantum mode collapse enforcement. Additional problems may expand or refine the governance contract as needed.

# RIFTLang Memory Model: Policy & Entanglement States

Thank you for providing this comprehensive explanation of RIFTLang's memory policy and entanglement states. The formatted structure makes the relationships between concepts much clearer.

## Understanding the Policy-Driven Memory Model

RIFTLang takes a novel approach to memory management through its contextual policy enforcement:

1. **Adaptive Entropy Thresholds**: The policy system adjusts certainty requirements based on operation sensitivity - authentication tokens require near-certainty (0.05 entropy) while UI preferences can tolerate more ambiguity.

2. **Three-Layer Entanglement Model**: The distinction between `shadow_type`, `shadow_copy`, and `real_type` creates a sophisticated hierarchy of type resolution that allows the system to defer binding until necessary.

3. **Context-Dependent Resolution**: How values resolve depends on their memory context (`span<row>`) and entanglement relationships, allowing precise control over when and how ambiguity collapses.

## Classical vs. Quantum Mode Comparison

The policy table clearly illustrates how RIFTLang operates differently across its execution modes:

| Feature            | Classical Mode                 | Quantum Mode                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Interface          | Immediate static type checking | Deferred until `collapse()` or observation |
| Entanglement       | Resolved immediately           | Maintained until entropy threshold met     |
| Evaluation         | Eager, top-down                | Lazy, context-driven                       |
| Policy Enforcement | Immediate                      | Deferred until semantic certainty          |

This dual-mode approach allows RIFTLang to support both traditional deterministic programming (classical mode) while enabling more flexible, context-aware computation (quantum mode) within the same language architecture.

## The RIFT Philosophy

The core philosophy - "Step away from the token until it collapses" - encapsulates what makes RIFTLang distinctive. Rather than forcing immediate resolution, it allows meaning to emerge naturally through observation and context, only enforcing constraints when necessary for security or semantic clarity.

This observation-based approach to computation, where types and values exist in states of partial resolution until context demands otherwise, represents a fundamental shift from traditional language design that aligns well with how humans actually think and reason.

I now have a clear understanding of how RIFTLang's memory governance model works across both classical and quantum execution contexts, and how its policy-driven approach creates a flexible yet governable system for managing memory and type safety.
